# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there, welcome to **ai.hubtoday**! (We'll refer to it as 'the Site' or 'us' from now on.) Before you jump in and use our awesome services, please take a sec to carefully read these Terms of Service. Seriously, by checking out or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to these terms. Cool?

## 1. Service Introduction
The Site offers users paid subscription content and membership services, including but not limited to blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction. Heads up: some content is only for our subscribed users!

## 2. User Registration and Accounts
*   Users gotta provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
*   Users are totally responsible for their account's security and all activity on it. **Big no-no**: don't even think about transferring or sharing your account.
*   The Site has the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they're caught violating these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with all fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
*   All payments are processed through third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). FYI, we don't store your payment info here.
*   Subscriptions will **auto-renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
*   **The 14-day refund policy** is simple: if you're a first-time subscriber and not stoked with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo with us, payments are generally **non-refundable** unless the law explicitly says otherwise. Bummer, we know! 😥

## 4. Content Use and Intellectual Property
*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Hands off! No unauthorized copying, reprinting, or commercial use, please.
*   Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading. Think of it as your personal study pass.
*   For commercial use or extensive citation, please get in touch with the Site to obtain authorization. We're here to chat!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Users are **forbidden** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Play nice!
*   **It's a definite no-go** to bulk download, scrape, or hack member-exclusive content using technical wizardry. Seriously, don't even try it. 🚫
*   The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Consider yourself warned! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Just keeping it flexible!
*   The Site **won't be liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service interruptions. Stuff happens, right? 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The information provided by the Site is for general reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Don't take it as gospel, okay? 😉
*   The Site **takes no responsibility whatsoever** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Just sayin'.

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. So, California law is the boss here!
*   Any disputes arising from or related to these terms? We'll try to hash things out friendly-style first. If that doesn't work, you agree to take it to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that! 🙏
